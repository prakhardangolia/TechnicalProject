# TechnicalProject

The main motivation was that many small suppliers don’t have their own logistics systems. They
often struggle to manage orders, track deliveries, or even connect with customers online. As a
result, they lose competitiveness against larger companies who already have advanced supply
chain systems.
"So, this project is designed to empower these small suppliers by giving them a digital platform
where they can showcase products, receive online customer orders, and manage logistics—all in
one system."
